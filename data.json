Low word count : This issue is triggered if the number of words on your webpage is less than 200.The amount of text placed on your webpage is a quality signal to search engines.Search engines prefer to provide as much information to users as possible, so pages with longer content tend to be placed higher in search results, as opposed to those with lower word counts."
